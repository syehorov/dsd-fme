## How to clone and build this branch

### Ubuntu 22.04/20.04/LM20/Debian Bullseye:

Using the included download-and-install.sh should make for a simple and painless clone, build, and install on newer Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Pi systems. Simply acquire or copy the script, and run it. Update: Ubuntu 23.04 and RPi Bullseye 64-bit has been tested working with the installer script and functions appropriately.

If you need all dependencies build and installed first (only on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Pi), run:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/audio_work/download-and-install.sh
sh download-and-install.sh
```

### Debian 12 (SID) / Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Updated Ncurses Dependencies)

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/audio_work/download-and-install-ubuntu2404lts.sh
sh download-and-install-ubuntu2404lts.sh
```

### Arch Based Distros:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/audio_work/download-and-install-Arch.sh
sh download-and-install-Arch.sh
```

### Other:

If you have dependencies already installed, please run this instead:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/audio_work/download-and-install-nodeps.sh
sh download-and-install-nodeps.sh
```

## Manual Install

First, install dependency packages. This guide will assume you are using Debian/Ubuntu based distros. Check your package manager for equivalent packages if different.

Debian/Mint/Ubuntu/Pi

```
sudo apt update
#Ubuntu 22.04 lts / Debian 11 and lower
sudo apt install libpulse-dev pavucontrol libsndfile1-dev libfftw3-dev liblapack-dev socat libusb-1.0-0-dev libncurses5 libncurses5-dev rtl-sdr librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake git wget make build-essential libcodec2-dev
#Ubuntu 24.04 lts / Debian 12
#sudo apt install libpulse-dev pavucontrol libsndfile1-dev libfftw3-dev liblapack-dev socat libusb-1.0-0-dev rtl-sdr librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake git wget make build-essential libncurses-dev libncurses6 libcodec2-dev
```

Fedora 36/37 -- from https://github.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/issues/99

```
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install libsndfile-devel fftw-devel lapack-devel rtl-sdr-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel libusb-devel cmake git ncurses ncurses-devel gcc wget pavucontrol gcc-c++ codec2-devel
```

Arch -- https://github.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/issues/153 and https://github.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/issues/153

```
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S libpulse cmake ncurses lapack perl fftw rtl-sdr codec2 base-devel libsndfile git wget rtl-sdr
```

## Headless Ubuntu Server/Pi

If running headless, swap out pavucontrol for pulsemixer, and also install pulseaudio as well. Attempting to install pavucontrol in a headless environment may attempt to install a minimal desktop environment. Note: Default behavior of pulseaudio in a headless environment may be to be muted, so check by opening pulsemixer and unmuting and routing audio appropriately.

```
sudo apt install libpulse-dev libsndfile1-dev libfftw3-dev liblapack-dev socat libusb-1.0-0-dev libncurses5 libncurses5-dev rtl-sdr librtlsdr-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake git wget make build-essential libncursesw5-dev pulsemixer pulseaudio libcodec2-dev
```

MBELib is considered a requirement in this build. You must read this notice prior to continuing. [MBElib Patent Notice](https://github.com/lwvmobile/mbelib#readme "MBElib Patent Notice") 

```
git clone https://github.com/lwvmobile/mbelib
git checkout ambe_tones
cd mbelib
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j `nproc`
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
cd ..
cd ..
```

Finish by running these steps to clone and build DSD-FME.

```
git clone https://github.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme
cd dsd-fme
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j `nproc`
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig

```

### LD_PATH

Some environments may require an LD path to be set to /usr/local/lib, similar to:
```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

### Windows Cygwin Builds

Cygwin builds now have an experimental semi-automatic installer, to run, follow steps below:

Open Windows PowerShell (not Command Prompt) and copy and paste all of this in all at once.

```
Invoke-WebRequest https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe -OutFile setup-x86_64.exe
.\setup-x86_64.exe --packages nano,libpulse-devel,libpulse-mainloop-glib0,libpulse-simple0,libpulse0,pulseaudio,pulseaudio-debuginfo,pulseaudio-equalizer,pulseaudio-module-x11,pulseaudio-module-zeroconf,pulseaudio-utils,sox-fmt-pulseaudio,libusb0,libusb1.0,libusb1.0-debuginfo,libusb1.0-devel,libncurses++w10,libncurses-devel,libncursesw10,ncurses,cmake,gcc-core,gcc-debuginfo,gcc-objc,git,make,socat,sox,sox-fmt-ao,zip,unzip,wget,gcc-g++,libsndfile-devel

```

Pick a Mirror. http://www.gtlib.gatech.edu mirror seems relatively fast. Nurse the Cygwin installer by clicking next and waiting for it to finish. Ignore the warning popup telling you to install libusb from sourceforge. Install the [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/ "Zadig") driver instead, if you haven't already and have an RTL Dongle. After Cygwin finishes installing, the installer sh script will download and run, be patient, it may also take a little while.

Then:

```
C:\cygwin64\bin\mintty.exe /bin/bash -l -c "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lwvmobile/dsd-fme/refs/heads/audio_work/download-and-install-cygwin.sh; sh download-and-install-cygwin.sh; dsd-fme;"

```

After the sh script finishes, dsd-fme should open. If not, then double click on the Cygwin Terminal desktop shortcut, and try running `dsd-fme`. If you chose to create a portable version, you will find the folder and zip file in the `C:\cygwin64\home\username` directory if using the default cygwin64 folder location.

You can also update your versions by using the cyg_rebuild.sh script `sh cyg_rebuild.sh`.

### Virtual Sinks

You may wish to direct sound into DSD-FME via Virtual Sinks. You may set up a Virtual Sink or two on your machine for routing audio in and out of applications to other applications using the following command, and opening up pavucontrol "PulseAudio Volume Control" in the menu (or `pulsemixer` in headless mode) to change line out of application to virtual sink, and line in of DSD-FME to monitor of virtual sink. This command will not persist past a reboot, so you will need to invoke them each time you reboot, or search for how to add this to your conf files for persistency if desired. Note: This setup is completely optional if using TCP Network Sink Audio and/or RTL Input. You may need to manually install either of these programs manually, if desired, or find suitable alternatives for pipewire-pulse such as pwvucontrol, or similar.

```
pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=virtual_sink  sink_properties=device.description=Virtual_Sink
pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=virtual_sink2  sink_properties=device.description=Virtual_Sink2
```

Already have this branch, and just want to pull the latest build? You can run the rebuild.sh file in the dsd-fme folder, or manually do the pull with the commands:

```
##Open your clone folder##
git pull
##cd into your build folder##
cd build
cmake ..
make -j `nproc`
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

### Applying Patches -- Recommended For Advanced Users Only

More experimental or potentially functionality changing or temperamental features may be included as seperate .patch files inside of the patch folder, and are not included in the source code by default. 
If users wish to try or use these patches, then they can apply patches and build/rebuild with the following procedure. Make sure you have changed to the dsd-fme directory first, either by the top
command, or by otherwise opening the terminal to the clone folder.

```
cd dsd-fme
git apply patch/patchname.patch
cd build
make
sudo make install
```

If you later wish to update to the latest version via `git pull`, you may first need to reset any patches, perform the `git pull`, and then reapply patches.
A procedure for this is similar to, but not limited to:

```
cd dsd-fme
git reset --hard
git pull
git apply patch/xyz.patch
cd build
make
sudo make install
```

NOTE: Patches can potential break over time with further changes to code, requiring merge resolution or other manual intervention to re-apply patches.
